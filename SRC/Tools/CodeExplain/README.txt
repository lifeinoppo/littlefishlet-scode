 this library is for code explain, 
 more specific rule will be listed as below , and 
 the explainer or  in other words -- code transfer will work as this way 
 
 
 the code of this   mainly  recommended to be python  , 
 each file named under the  keyword .
 
 explain.py is supposed to be the initial port or main function. 
 
 
1. in js file's beginning , will have to require some library. 
here we use :
{
	
	acquire(libraryName);   
		
	}
to get this implemented. 

acquire(libraryName)  ==  require(PathOfJsFileTobeIncluded(libraryName))

PathOfJsFileTobeIncluded  has to be implemented later .


2. interface transfer 
if one class implements a same-name interface , 
it will make communicate between components much easier . 
So here we need an interface transfer .

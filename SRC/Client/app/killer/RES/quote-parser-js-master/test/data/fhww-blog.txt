This episode is a special double header. It features one interview and one performance.
First up is Kaskade (@Kaskade), widely considered one of the Founding Fathers of Progressive House Music. He’s been voted “America’s Best DJ” twice by DJ Times, headlined Coachella 4 times, and been nominated for a Grammy 5 times.
If you want to hear a cool behind-the-scenes story about how he created the hit song 4 am, check out this 2-minute clip.
Next, you’ll hear Sekou Andrews (@SekouAndrews), the most impressive poetic voice I’ve ever heard. I first saw him perform at TED, where he blew my mind. Sekou is a schoolteacher turned 2x National Poetry Slam champion. He has presented privately for Barack Obama, Bono, Oprah Winfrey, Maya Angelou, as well as for many Fortune 500 companies.  If you ever have the chance to hear him live or hire him, take it.
Or, just spend a minute and learn about the “soul selfie.”

Each one of these takes a few minutes to get warmed up, so be patient. There are gems in both. Among other things…

Kaskade covers his first breaks, making his own luck, formative musical influences, and we dig into his notetaking process, and the origins of one of his biggest hits.
Sekou will inspire you to be inspired by your story. Do you want to change your narrative, your internal dialogue, to be more successful? Do you need to get back on the horse, or have an effective pep talk in your back pocket?

This might be the recording you listen to over and over again. There is a lot of practical philosophy embedded in and between the lines, so listen to it all.

“My parents never really told me I couldn’t do anything.” – Shaun White
This particular episode comes from a fun event — my first live podcast at the iconic Troubadour in L.A. It sold out through my newsletter in 30 minutes, so thanks to all of you who came. If you haven’t signed up for the email newsletter, you should check it out. It’s free. Just go to fourhourworkweek.com/friday.
There were quite a few amazing guests at the event, and we’re going to divide them up into a few episodes.
Shaun White (@ShaunWhite) is our first — a professional snowboarder and skateboarder. Among his formidable feats of strength:

He’s a 2x Olympic Gold medalist.
He holds the X Games record for gold medals at 15, as well as the highest overall medal count at 24.
Shaun has earned the number two spot on BusinessWeek’s list of the 100 most powerful and marketable athletes.
And — ACH-TUNG! — for those near L.A. or willing to travel, Shaun is hosting an incredible event called Air + Style. Think of it as X Games meets Coachella, where you can listen to world-famous bands and then see jumps off of a 16-story ramp (no joke), among other excitement. Check it out at airandstyle.com. For 20% off general or VIP admission, you can use code “TimFerriss.” I get no cut, and I’ve already bought four tickets for myself and friends. The code is only good until midnight PT on February 19th (Friday).

If you only have a couple of minutes, listen here to discover who Shaun considered one of his biggest mentors and the lessons he learned.
Enjoy!

This podcast is also brought to you by Wealthfront. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive (in a good way) set-it-and-forget-it investing service, led by technologists from places like Apple. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and now has more than $2.5B under management. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it’s all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams.
Check out wealthfront.com/tim, take their risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and they’ll show you—for free–exactly the portfolio they’d put you in. If you want to just take their advice and do it yourself, you can. Well worth a few minutes to explore: wealthfront.com/tim.
QUESTION(S) OF THE DAY: Based on Shaun’s two-goal philosophy, what two goals would you set for yourself? How would they help with your life or business? Please let me know in the comments.

“I believe that peace means that one person has the biggest stick. I build those sticks.” – Walter O’Brien
This episode might make your head explode… in the best way possible.
Walter O’Brien (AKA “Scorpion”) (@walterobrienscs) is the founder of Scorpion Computer Services and ConciergeUp.com, a for-hire global think tank that provides intelligence-on-demand as a concierge service. The tag line for the latter is, “for any funded need.”

Need to defend against chemical warfare?
Move an entire manufacturing operation over a weekend?
 Save a loved one from a deceitful spouse?
 Thread the needle on a thorny legal issue?
Become a pop star in a foreign country?

When Walter and his team of 2,000+ distributed geniuses say “any funded need,” they mean it literally.
Born in Ireland, Walter was diagnosed as a child prodigy with an IQ of 197. He became an Irish national coding champion and competed in the Olympics in informatics.
Fast forward to today, he and Scorpion get paid to fix every imaginable problem for billionaires, startups, governments, Fortune 500 companies, and people like you and me. On the large side, it ranges from mitigating risk on $1.9 trillion of investments to inventing artificial intelligence engines to protect United States war fighters in Afghanistan.
Walter is also the executive producer of the hit CBS TV show Scorpion, inspired by his life, which has reached more than 26 million television viewers.
I was introduced to Walter well before the show, and we go deep in this conversation, with lots of amazing and also hilarious examples of problem solving.
If you only have a few minutes, listen to this mind-blowing segment on head transplants. (Yes, head transplants.)
Enjoy!

This podcast is brought to you by Wealthfront. Wealthfront is a massively disruptive (in a good way) set-it-and-forget-it investing service, led by technologists from places like Apple. It has exploded in popularity in the last two years and now has more than $2.5B under management. Why? Because you can get services previously limited to the ultra-wealthy and only pay pennies on the dollar for them, and it’s all through smarter software instead of retail locations and bloated sales teams.
Check out wealthfront.com/tim, take their risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and they’ll show you—for free–exactly the portfolio they’d put you in. If you want to just take their advice and do it yourself, you can. Well worth a few minutes to explore: wealthfront.com/tim.
This podcast is also brought to you by Boll & Branch. There is a lot of nonsense in the bedding business. For instance, did you know thread-count is not a good measurement of quality? It’s a total myth. The “Made in Italy” label? It isn’t something you should necessarily pay extra for because it generally means it’s just finished in Italy and woven in places like China.
The general industry mark-up for bedding is 700 to 800 percent at most retailers. Boll & Branch creates incredibly high-quality bedding. They are the same sheets you’ll find at my home in San Francisco.
The best part? You can try anything you order at home for 30 days. If you don’t love it, send it back and get a full refund. Go to Boll & Branch and use promo code “TIM” for 20% off your entire order. Whether sheets, towels, blankets, duvet covers, or anything else. Shipping is always free.
QUESTION(S) OF THE DAY: What is a problem you would like to have ConciergeUp solve for you? Please let me know in the comments.

“We can’t out-obedience the competition.” – Seth Godin
I expected this episode to be amazing, and Seth 10x’d expectations. He’s incredible.
Seth Godin (@thisissethsblog) is the author of 17 bestselling books that have been translated into more than 35 languages. He writes about the way ideas spread, marketing, strategic quitting, leadership, and — most of all — challenging the status quo in all areas. His books include Linchpin, Tribes, The Dip, Purple Cow, and What to Do When it’s Your Turn (and it’s Always Your Turn).
Seth has founded several companies, including Yoyodyne and Squidoo. His blog (which you can find by typing “Seth” into Google) is one of the most popular in the world. In 2013, Godin was inducted into the Direct Marketing Hall of Fame. Recently, Godin turned the book publishing world on its ear by launching a series of four books via Kickstarter. The campaign reached its goal in just three hours and became the most successful book project in Kickstarter history.
If you only have a couple of minutes, you should definitely listen to this segment on how to handle life transitions.
In this episode, we cover dozens of topics and stories, including some he’s never discussed publicly before. Here’s a small sample:

A list of the audiobooks he listens to repeatedly, some once per month
His morning routine, breakfast, dietary habits, and email processing
Meditative practices
Why he’s fixated on and mastered coffee and vodka, despite the fact that he consumes neither
Suggestions for going from “wantrepreneur” to entrepreneur
How to determine if you’re better off a “freelancer” or “entrepreneur,” and the differences in his mind
Why he has the most impressive cookbook collection our mutual chef friends have ever seen
His rules for saying “no” to opportunities, how he thinks about public speaking, etc.
His recipe for honey oatmeal vodka, and his favorite chocolates in the world
Thoughts on improving how parents educate their children
General philosophies and guidelines he uses for life management

Enjoy!

“Establish business relations with poverty.”
– Seneca
These 10-15 minutes are gold. I revisit this letter of Seneca at least once a quarter, and I hope you find this episode equally powerful.
The careful listener will find an extremely practical blueprint (and exercises) for optimizing performance in high-stress situations.
If you only have 60 seconds for one highlight, pay particular attention to this passage.
If you enjoy the teachings, I highly recommend listening to more of Seneca’s letters. All of my favorites can be found in The Tao of Seneca: Practical Letters from a Stoic Master. For more audiobooks I love, take a look at audible.com/timsbooks.
Enjoy!

    The Music a World-Class DJ Uses to Fall Asleep

I get asked about nighttime rituals a lot.
Though I always ask high-profile podcast guests about their morning routines, the evening wind down can get neglected.
So, what to do if you have trouble falling asleep? Or, like nearly all males in my family, you have severe onset insomnia? The morning might be a breeze, while the darkness is a nightmare.
I thought it’d be fun to look at a real-world example, sent to me via text by Justin Boreta, best known as “Boreta” of The Glitch Mob, one of the world’s biggest electronic bands. Their music has been featured in movies like Sin City II, Edge of Tomorrow, Captain America, and Spiderman.
Below is what he SMS’d me after listening to my 5 Tools I Use for Faster and Better Sleep (Thanks for permission to share, Justin!):
Ahoy, Cap’n Ferriss :) I just heard your sleep podcast and wanted to share a great little routine I’ve been doing.
An incredible composer named Max Richter created this 8-hour album that is designed to help you fall asleep. http://time.com/4022816/max-richter-sleep/
There is a shortened version that I listen to on Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/album/7tP7WLxusDpTi1gf1JFsrT
I put it on very quietly as I am starting my bedtime routine, so it usually ends 15-20 minutes after I’m asleep. Or I will use the Sonos sleep timer, if I’m at home.
It started to have this Pavlovian knockout effect after a while if I use it every day, like a lullaby.
Alternatively, if that’s too much melody, there’s an artist called Mute Button that has high-quality, long-field recordings. The gentle rain sounds + sleep timer are fantastic. I find it great to drown out hotel sounds when traveling. https://open.spotify.com/artist/53gtZjk5vhB6CxRUEbnPet
If you find these tips useful, don’t miss my longer interview with Justin, which is full of detailed tactics for life and business.
Questions for you all — Would you like me to describe more nighttime routines of top performers? And what nighttime routines or tools have you found most helpful in your own life?
Please let me know in the comments below.  Thanks!
Sweet dreams,
Tim

    Naval Ravikant By Kris Krüg | CC BY-SA 2.0, via Wikimedia Commons
“I actually think happiness is the absence of suffering. It comes from peace. That comes from being careful about desire, judgment, and reaction.” – Naval Ravikant
When a guest is nominated for “Podcast of the Year,” that’s a good reason to bring them back for more. That’s why Naval Ravikant (@naval) is here for round two, and this time, he’s answering your most-requested questions. For those of you who missed his first episode, Naval is the CEO and a co-founder of AngelList. He has invested in more than 100 companies, including many “unicorn” mega-successes.  He is the person I call most for start-up advice.
Most important, he has developed a diverse set of skills and rules-of-thumb that can applied nearly everywhere . Even if you have no interest in startups or investing, this is well worth your time. In this episode, Naval answers your top-10 questions from Reddit, including such topics as:

Artificial intelligence
Most-recommended books
Happiness hacks
Conflict resolution
Start-up tips
And much, much more…

Enjoy!
